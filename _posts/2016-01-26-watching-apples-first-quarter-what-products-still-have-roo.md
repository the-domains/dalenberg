description: 'No predictions, just a few things to watch and possibly interpret in the numbers. And, at the end, a question: Will the iPhone gain market share in a saturated market-just like the Mac stubbornly does? Apple is circumspect about the details that go into its quarterly numbers, so we have to rely on conjecture.'
