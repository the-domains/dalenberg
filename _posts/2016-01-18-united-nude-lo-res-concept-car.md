description: "Wider, taller, and meaner than its showroom cousin, the Nissan Titan Warrior Concept is yet another design exercise we'd like to take for a spin - in the dirt, not on the road. The rugged truck sits three inches higher than stock, and is six inches wider, as well, both necessary to fit the 37-inch off-road tires that sit on 18-inch dark matte aluminum alloy wheels."
